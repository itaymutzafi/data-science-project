    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Objective\n",
    "The primary objective is to develop a machine learning pipeline capable of predicting short-term movements in the stock market, specifically focusing on **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**. Unlike traditional forecasting which often targets raw prices, our goal is to predict the **Logarithmic Returns** of the next trading day ($t+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Target Variable Selection: The Stationarity Challenge\n",
    "Financial time series are notoriously **non-stationary**, meaning their statistical properties (mean, variance) change over time. Standard regression models (e.g., Linear Regression) rely on the assumption of stationarity to generalize effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we transform our target variable from Raw Price ($P_t$) to Log-Returns ($Y_t$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_t = \\ln(P_{t+1}) - \\ln(P_t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Log-Returns?**\n",
    "1.  **Stationarity:** They exhibit more stable statistical properties than raw prices.\n",
    "2.  **Additivity:** Log-returns are time-additive, simplifying multi-period analysis.\n",
    "3.  **Normality:** They often approximate a normal distribution better than simple percentage returns."

    "We employ a dual-metric evaluation strategy to balance statistical rigor with financial reality.\n",

    "$$MSE = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Financial Metric: Sharpe Ratio**\n",
    "$$Sharpe = \\frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{\\sigma_p} \\times \\sqrt{252}$$\n",
    "*Rationale:* Measures risk-adjusted return. A model with low MSE might still lose money if it misses significant market moves or mispredicts direction. The Sharpe ratio ensures the strategy justifies the risk taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Trading Metric: Directional Accuracy (DA)**\n",
    "$$DA = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{1}_{sign(y_i) == sign(\\hat{y}_i)}$$\n",
    "*Rationale:* In many trading strategies, correctly predicting the *direction* (Long/Short) is more critical than the exact magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Validation Strategy: Strict Walk-Forward\n",
    "To prevent **Look-Ahead Bias**, we strictly use `TimeSeriesSplit` (expanding window) and avoid random shuffling. Future data must never leak into the training set."
